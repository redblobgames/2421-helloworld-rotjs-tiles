This is a quick&dirty test of using [[https://github.com/ondras/rot.js][rot.js]] with [[https://kenney.nl/assets/1-bit-pack][Kenney sprites]]. It's minimal:

- there's no build step â€” no npm, no webpack, etc.
- index.html loads the pre-built rot.js
- the js loads the tile sheet into rot.js
- the js loads the example tmx tile map and renders it
- lots of stuff is hard coded
